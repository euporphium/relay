# Agent Instructions

This repository uses structured, domain-focused documentation.

Start with:
- docs/index.md

Guidelines:
- Load only the documentation relevant to the task.
- Use domain docs for rules and docs/architecture.md for system-level context.
- Avoid duplicating documentation in code or comments.
- Any intentional deviation from framework defaults or common best practices
  should be documented.
